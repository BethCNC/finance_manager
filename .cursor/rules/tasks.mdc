# Project Tasks & Roadmap

## 🚀 Phase 1: Core Functionality (Current)

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Project setup with React + TypeScript + Tailwind
- [x] Notion API integration with Vercel functions
- [x] Dashboard UI with metric cards
- [x] Transaction list with real Notion data
- [x] Auto-refresh data sync (30s)
- [x] Responsive sidebar navigation
- [x] Loading states

### 🔨 In Progress
- [ ] Transaction creation form
  - Modal with input fields (name, amount, date, type)
  - POST endpoint `/api/notion/create`
  - Notion pages.create() integration
  - Refresh data after creation

### 📋 Up Next
- [ ] Budget tracking screen implementation
  - Connect to existing Months database
  - Visual budget bars with percentage
  - Category-based spending breakdown
  
- [ ] Analytics screen with real data
  - Monthly spending trends
  - Category distribution chart
  - Year-over-year comparisons

## 🤖 Phase 2: AI Integration

### Planned Features
- [ ] AI Chat Assistant
  - Claude API integration
  - Spending analysis prompts
  - Budget recommendations
  - Natural language queries

- [ ] AI Insights Generation
  - Automatic spending pattern detection
  - Anomaly detection (unusual expenses)
  - Savings opportunities identification
  - Personalized financial tips

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Create `/api/ai-chat.ts` endpoint
- [ ] Add Claude API key to environment
- [ ] Build conversation state management
- [ ] Design insight card components
- [ ] Implement streaming responses

## 📊 Phase 3: Enhanced Features

### Data Visualization
- [ ] Interactive charts (Chart.js or Recharts)
- [ ] Spending heatmap calendar
- [ ] Income vs expense timeline
- [ ] Category breakdown pie chart

### User Experience
- [ ] Transaction search/filter
- [ ] Date range picker
- [ ] Export to CSV/PDF
- [ ] Dark mode toggle
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts

### Notion Enhancements
- [ ] Add Categories to Expenses database
- [ ] Recurring transaction templates
- [ ] Tags/labels system
- [ ] Attachment support

## 🔐 Phase 4: Security & Performance

### Security
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Rate limiting on API endpoints
- [ ] User authentication (Firebase Auth?)
- [ ] Role-based access control

### Performance
- [ ] Response caching (60s TTL)
- [ ] Pagination for large datasets
- [ ] Lazy loading components
- [ ] Image optimization
- [ ] Bundle size optimization

## 🧪 Phase 5: Testing & Quality

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] Unit tests for hooks (Jest + React Testing Library)
- [ ] API endpoint tests
- [ ] E2E tests (Playwright)
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode
- [ ] ESLint + Prettier setup

### Documentation
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Component Storybook
- [ ] User guide
- [ ] Video walkthrough

## 🚢 Deployment & DevOps

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Custom domain setup
- [ ] SSL/HTTPS configuration
- [ ] CDN optimization
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] Analytics (Google Analytics/Plausible)

### CI/CD
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Automated testing pipeline
- [ ] Preview deployments
- [ ] Staging environment

## 💡 Future Ideas (Backlog)

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Multi-currency support
- [ ] Receipt scanning (OCR)
- [ ] Bill reminders
- [ ] Investment tracking
- [ ] Goal setting & tracking
- [ ] Family/shared budgets

### Integrations
- [ ] Bank account sync (Plaid)
- [ ] Email receipt parsing
- [ ] Calendar integration for scheduled payments
- [ ] Slack/Discord notifications
- [ ] Mobile app (React Native)

### AI Enhancements
- [ ] Voice commands
- [ ] Predictive budgeting
- [ ] Auto-categorization
- [ ] Financial report generation
- [ ] Tax preparation assistance

## 🐛 Known Issues

### High Priority
- [ ] API functions don't work with `npm start` (use `vercel dev`)
- [ ] Need better error messaging for Notion connection failures
- [ ] Loading state doesn't show on re-fetch

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Transaction list should be virtualized for performance
- [ ] No empty state when no transactions exist
- [ ] Chart gradient needs to work better with black theme

### Low Priority
- [ ] Mobile nav menu needs implementation
- [ ] Keyboard navigation for modals
- [ ] Focus management improvements

## 📝 Technical Debt

- [ ] Extract MetricCard to separate component file
- [ ] Create shared types file for interfaces
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries
- [ ] Add PropTypes or Zod validation
- [ ] Centralize API base URL
- [ ] Create constants file for database IDs
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to utility functions

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- View real-time financial data from Notion ✅
- See income, expenses, and balance
- Browse transaction history
- Mobile responsive design

### v1.0 Goals
- Create/edit/delete transactions
- Set and track budgets
- View basic analytics
- AI-powered insights
- 95%+ TypeScript coverage

### v2.0 Vision
- Multi-user support
- Advanced AI features
- Bank integrations
- Mobile app
- 10,000+ monthly active users
