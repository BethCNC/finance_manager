## üîÑ Transfer Handling

### **Critical Rule: Transfers are NOT Double-Counted**

**The Problem:**
When money moves between accounts (e.g., Bryan transfers $100 from SECU 8182 to Cash App):
- SECU 8182 shows: -$100 (debit)
- Cash App shows: +$100 (credit)
- This creates $200 of transactions for a $0 net movement

**The Solution:**
‚úÖ **Only transfer FEES are recorded as transactions**
‚ùå **Transfer principal amounts are excluded/reconciled**

**Example:**
```
Transfer: $100 from SECU 8182 to Cash App with $2.50 fee

Recorded in Notion:
- Amount: -$2.50
- Category: Transfer Fee
- Account: SECU 8182
- Who: Bryan
- Description: "Transfer fee to Cash App"

NOT recorded:
- The $100 debit from SECU 8182
- The $100 credit to Cash App
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents inflated expense/income totals
- Accurately reflects true spending vs transfers
- Fee tracking identifies optimization opportunities
- Clean data for AI analysis

## üéØ AI Agent Data Requirements

### **What the AI Needs to Understand:**

1. **Couple Dynamics:**
   - This is a household unit with two individuals
   - Each person has their own accounts
   - Some accounts overlap (both use Cash App)
   - Financial decisions should consider both perspectives

2. **Account Ownership:**
   - Bryan: SECU 8182, SECU 2791, Cash App
   - Beth: SECU Beth, Cash App, Apple Cash
   - AI should know which accounts belong to whom

3. **Transfer Intelligence:**
   - Transfers are NOT expenses
   - Only fees matter
   - Don't flag transfer amounts as overspending

4. **Data Quality:**
   - Data has been meticulously cleaned
   - Trust the categorization
   - No duplicate detection needed (already done)

5. **Context Awareness:**
   - When Beth asks "How much did I spend?", show ONLY her transactions
   - When asking household questions, combine both
   - Respect individual privacy while enabling joint planning
