## 🎯 Next Steps

### **Phase 1: Integrate Transaction Data** (Today)

**Goal:** Make AI aware of Beth & Bryan's actual finances

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// In /api/ai-chat.js

// 1. Load transactions from Notion
const transactions = await fetchAllTransactions();

// 2. Create financial summary
const summary = {
  total_transactions: 262,
  total_income: 14557.59,
  total_expenses: 13426.48,
  savings_rate: 7.8,
  by_person: {
    Beth: {transactions: 162, ...},
    Bryan: {transactions: 100, ...},
  },
  by_category: {...},
  subscriptions: 67,
};

// 3. Create AI system prompt
const systemPrompt = `
You are a personal financial advisor for Beth and Bryan, a couple working to improve their finances.

Current Financial Data:
${JSON.stringify(summary, null, 2)}

Your role:
- Analyze their finances
- Provide personalized recommendations
- Help them reach their goals (house, retirement, reduce stress)
- Be empathetic and non-judgmental
- Give actionable advice
`;

// 4. Send to GPT-4o-mini
const response = await model.invoke([
  {role: 'system', content: systemPrompt},
  {role: 'user', content: userQuestion},
]);
```
