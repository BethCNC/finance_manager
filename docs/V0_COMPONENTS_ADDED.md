## How to Use

### Starting the Development Server

```bash
# With Vercel functions (recommended for API testing)
vercel dev

# Or just React dev server (no API)
npm start
```

### Navigation

The app now has full navigation:
1. Click any tab in the bottom nav to navigate
2. Click "More" for additional pages
3. Click the menu icon (top right) to open the side drawer

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Build is successful - no errors! ✅

## Code Style Notes

All components follow your coding standards:
- Arrow functions with parentheses: `(param) => {...}`
- Minimal object brace spacing: `{name, value}`
- Only Tailwind classes (no inline styles)
- TypeScript interfaces for props

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Implement Transaction List** - Replace placeholder with actual transaction table
2. **Add AI Advisor** - Integrate AI chat for financial advice
3. **Build Subscriptions Page** - Track and manage recurring payments
4. **Create Bills Page** - Schedule and track bill payments
5. **Add Settings** - User preferences, account management
6. **Enhanced Analytics** - More charts and insights

## Troubleshooting

### Navigation not working
- Make sure you're using React Router `<Link>` components
- Check browser console for errors

### Animations not smooth
- Verify `tailwind.config.js` has keyframes defined
- Clear browser cache

### Bottom nav overlapping content
- Add `pb-24` (padding bottom) to page content
- The layout already includes `pt-14` for top bar

## Files to Review

Key files to understand the integration:
1. `src/App.tsx` - Main app with routing
2. `src/components/BottomNav.tsx` - Bottom navigation
3. `src/components/MenuDrawer.tsx` - Side menu
4. `tailwind.config.js` - Animation configuration

## Summary
