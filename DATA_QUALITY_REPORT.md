## 🔄 Transfer Handling Verification

### **Transfer-Related Transactions:** 20 (7.6%)
- **Transfer Fee:** 19 transactions
- **Transfers:** 1 transaction

**Quality Check:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

**What This Means:**
- Transfers between accounts are properly handled
- Only fees are recorded (19 fee transactions)
- Principal transfer amounts excluded (prevents double-counting)
- Total transfers: 20 out of 262 (7.6%) - reasonable for 5 accounts

**Example Validation:**
If you transferred money 10 times between accounts:
- ❌ BAD: 20 transactions (10 debits + 10 credits) = double-counting
- ✅ GOOD: 10 fee transactions only = your current state

**Your data is correctly structured!** 🎉

---

## 💼 Business Expenses

### **Business Transactions:** 8 (3.1%)
- **Business Category:** 3 transactions
- **Business Flag (checkbox):** 8 total

**Note:** Some transactions are flagged as business but may be in other categories (e.g., Software used for business).

**Tax Implication:**
- At least 8 transactions available for tax deductions
- Likely more if software/subscriptions are business-related
- AI agent can help identify additional business expenses

---

## 🔁 Subscription Tracking

### **Subscription Transactions:** 67 (25.6%)
- Over **1/4 of all transactions are subscriptions!**
- Average: ~20 subscriptions per month
- This is a major expense category

**Categories with Subscriptions:**
- **Software:** 42 transactions (most are likely subscriptions)
- **Monthly Bills:** 15 transactions (recurring)
- Other categories may include subscriptions too

**AI Opportunity:**
This high subscription count (67 transactions over 3.3 months = ~20/month) represents a major optimization opportunity. AI can:
1. Identify unused subscriptions
2. Calculate total monthly subscription cost
3. Recommend cancellations
4. Track subscription price increases
